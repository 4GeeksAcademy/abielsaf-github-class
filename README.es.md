# 👋 Hi, I’m @abielsaf !
## I'm learning how to code with the help of [4GeeksAcademy](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/index?lang=en).

<p>My name is Ángel Bielsa and I'm from Spain, I previosly worked in the eSports industry as an analyst, where I developed  my communication and teamwork skills.<p>

<p>I'm excited about the opportunity to learn new skills and develop a career in programming as a full-stack developer. :computer: </p>
